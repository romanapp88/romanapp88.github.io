        <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms.

      <section id="subscription-terms">
        <h2>SUBSCRIPTION TERMS</h2>
        <h3>Free trial</h3>
        <p>We may offer a free trial subscription for service. Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial, you will be automatically charged a price indicated on the payment screen for a chosen subscription period.</p>

        <h3>Subscription</h3>
        <p>The subscription renews automatically at the end of each period (each week, month, 6 months, year, or otherwise, depending on the option selected by you at the time of purchase) until you cancel.</p>

        <h3>Payment method</h3>
        <p>Payment will be charged to the payment method you submitted at the time of purchase at confirmation of purchase. You authorize us to charge the applicable subscription fees to the payment method that you submit.</p>

        <h3>Cancellation</h3>
        <p>Canceling your subscription only disables automatic renewal. You will continue to have access to all features until the end of your current billing period.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>App Store (iOS):</strong> You can cancel a subscription or free trial anytime through your Apple ID account settings. To avoid charges, cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the trial or current period. Only you can manage your subscriptions. Learn more at <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Support</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Google Play (Android):</strong> You can cancel a subscription or free trial anytime in your Google Play account settings. To avoid charges, cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the trial or current period. Only you can manage your subscriptions. Learn more at <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Support</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>If purchased on our website:</strong> You can cancel a free trial or a subscription through settings on your website account or in your settings in PayPal at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial or then-current subscription period. Or visit this <a href="https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/autopay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal page</a> to manage your recurring payments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change subscription fees at any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on the app and/or by sending you an email notification, or in another prominent way. If you do not wish to pay the new fees, you can cancel the applicable subscription prior to the change going into effect.</p>

        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>All purchases are final and non-refundable, unless required by applicable law. By completing a purchase, you acknowledge and agree that payments are non-refundable and non-exchangeable.</p>
        <p><em>For EU Residents:</em> If you reside in the European Union, you have the right to withdraw from a service agreement within fourteen (14) days of the purchase date, without charge and without giving any reason—unless you provided consent for the service to begin immediately. By making a purchase, you expressly consent and acknowledge that the performance of the service starts immediately after your payment is validated and the purchase is delivered. As a result, you waive your right of withdrawal once the digital content or service has been fully delivered to you. If you cancel within 14 days of purchase and the service has not been fully delivered, you may be eligible for a proportionate refund based on the extent of service already provided.</p>
